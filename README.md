# Problem

You want to create a git tag that is next version from previous git tag. You want to write the next version to any version.txt file you may have around, and also your pyproject.toml.

It's easy but it's boring, just running fistbump will do it for you.

## Example session

```
‚ùØ fistbump --minor

New version: 1.2.0
######### File: pyproject.toml
[build-system]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
requires = ["setuptools"]
...

version = "1.2.0"
